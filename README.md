# Vessel Collision Risk Assessment and Forecasting (VCRA/F)
### Official Python implementation of the VCRA/F model from the paper "Collision Risk Assessment and Forecasting on Maritime Data"


# Installation 
In order to use VCRA/F in your project, download all necessary modules in your directory of choice via pip or conda, and install their corresponding dependencies, as the following commands suggest:

```Python
# Using pip/virtualenv
pip install âˆ’r requirements.txt

# Using conda
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

To reproduce the experimental study of the paper (VCRA/F vs. related work), please install the ```sklearn-rvm``` library (sklearn-rvm.readthedocs.io).


# Usage


In order to discover encountering vessels and create the training dataset for VCRA, please consult the code in the notebook ```4-encountering-vessels.ipynb```

In order to train the VCRA model, please run the script ```5-comparing-with-related-work.py``` using the following arguments:

```
python 5-comparing-with-related-work.py --model mlp
```

To reproduce the experimental study of the paper, please execute the code in the notebooks ```5-comparing-with-related-work``` (quality of VCRA vs. related work), ```6-comparing-models-latency``` (response time of VCRA vs. related work), and ```7-model-transparency``` (VCRA model explainability).

In order to assess the collision risk of future encountering processes, one must first train a VRF model for predicting vessels' locations. Since VRF models can be deployed in a plug and play mode, one can use whatever VRF model he/she finds fit (e.g., [https://github.com/DataStories-UniPi/VLF_VRF](https://github.com/DataStories-UniPi/VLF_VRF)). Afterwards, for the predicted locations, run the code in the notebook ```8-vcrf-encountering-vessels-arrnn.ipynb``` in order to discover future encountering processes (along with their corresponding CRI) and reproduce the experimental study of VCRF as well.
